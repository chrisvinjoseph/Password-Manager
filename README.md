# Password-Manager
Simple Crypto++ based password manager

Goals right now:
1. Fix bugs and clean up interface
2. Clean up some of the messier classes
3. Add a feature to copy retrieved password to clipboard 
(Although this may not happen since linux uses X11, for which the clipboard is significantly harder to manipulate than Windows/MacOS)
